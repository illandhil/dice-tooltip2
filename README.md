A [FoundryVTT](http://foundryvtt.com/) module that shows dice and bonus information when hovering over
an item/spell/ability/skills/etc. in an actor sheet.

<b>Version 2.50 "should" be compatible with FoundryVTT 11 and 10.</b></br>
<b>Version 2.40 is compatible with FoundryVTT 10 and is NOT compatible with FoundryVTT 9.<br>Use 2.3.1 if you still want to use this module with FoundryVTT 9.</b>

<b>Only works with the D&D5E system 0.95 or later</b>

This is useful for those who:
* Want a quick lookup of what will be rolled for a particular attack, check, save, etc.
* Want to roll physical dice, but still maintain all the convenience that Foundry provides.

Tooltips are provided for the following areas of the character sheet:

|Hover Over|Displays|Sample Tooltips|
|---|---|---|
|Ability|Ability Check<br/>Saving Throw|![Ability Tooltip Example](assets/images/AbilityTooltip.png)|
|Item|Attack Roll<br/>Damage Roll<br/>Versatile Damage<br/>Healing Roll<br/>Save DC|![](assets/images/MeleeAttackTooltip.png)<br/>![](assets/images/VersatileTooltip.png)<br/>![](assets/images/SpellAttackTooltip.png)<br/>![](assets/images/HealingTooltip.png)<br/>![](assets/images/SpellSaveTooltip.png)|
|Short Rest|Remaining Hit Dice|<img src="assets/images/ShortRestTooltip.png" width="150" height="150">|
|Skill|Skill Check|![Skill Tooltip Example](assets/images/SkillCheckTooltip.png)|

Favorites in the Tidy5e sheet also have tooltips.

This has been tested with the following sheets:
* Default 5e Character Sheet
* Default 5e NPC Sheet
* Sky's Alternate 5e Sheet

Your mileage may vary with other sheets.

# Attribution & History

This module was originally written by Steffan Poulsen (https://github.com/SteffanPoulsen/dice-tooltip).

His work appeared to be broken with the release of Foundry 0.8 (new Dice API) and updates to the Tidy 5e Sheets 
and it didn't look like it was going to get fixed anytime soon.  So I forked his
work to this location, fixed those main issues, plus make several enhancements
to the presentation of the tooltip and the code itself.

Special thanks to @thatlonelybugbear who helped figure out the compatibility issues with FoundryVTT v10.
